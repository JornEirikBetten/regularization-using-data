TypeError: scan body function carry input and carry output must have the same pytree structure, but they differ:

The input carry component train_state.params is a <class 'dict'> with 9 children but the corresponding component of the carry output is a <class 'dict'> with 1 child, so the numbers of children do not match, with the symmetric difference of key sets: {'DropoutResNetBlock_7' 'batch_stats' 'DropoutResNetBlock_3' 'bn_init' 'DropoutResNetBlock_0' 'DropoutResNetBlock_2' 'DropoutResNetBlock_5' 'DropoutResNetBlock_4' 'DropoutResNetBlock_1' 'DropoutResNetBlock_6'}.

Revise the function so that the carry output has the same pytree structure as the carry input.
